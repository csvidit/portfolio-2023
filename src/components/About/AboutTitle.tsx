        I am particularly strong in full-stack web development using frameworks
        like Next.js, and have a track record of great outcomes in native
        Android development. I like the design part of development as well as
        the backend, because that puts the focus back on end user. I am very
        adaptive, having performed well in both team and independent
        professional and leadership environments. I understand business as well
        as I do code, and thrive in the intersection of the two.
